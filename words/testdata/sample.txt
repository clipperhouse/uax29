In 1664, the city was named in honor of the [[Duke of York]], who would become King [[James II of England]].

===Early history===

In the [[Pre-Columbian era|precolonial era]], the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] Native Americans, including the [[Lenape]]. Their homeland, known as [[Lenapehoking]], included Staten Island, Manhattan, the Bronx, the western portion of Long Island (including the areas that would later become the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens), and the [[Lower Hudson Valley]].<ref>Evan T. Pritchard (2002). ''Native New Yorkers: the legacy of the Algonquin people of New York'', p. 27; {{ISBN|1-57178-107-2}}</ref>

The [[Padrón Real]] of 1527, the first scientific map to show the East Coast of North America continuously, was informed by Gomes' expedition and labeled the northeastern United States as ''Tierra de Esteban Gómez'' in his honor.<ref>WPA Writer's Project: ''A Maritime History of New York'', p. 246; Going Coastal Productions (2004) {{ISBN|0-9729803-1-8}}</ref>
