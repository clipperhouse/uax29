Having created a new StringSegmenter (#31) I am beginning to find the API a bit sprawling/verbose. Too many nouns. The distinct types (nouns) are necessary, but the user should have little interest in them.

Public methods

I’d prefer that we have just 3 methods per package: words.FromString(s), words.FromBytes(b), words.FromReader(r). We describe their return values simply as iterators. Focus on what to do instead of what they are. “Do” == “call Next() in for loop”.

(* We might wish to describe FromReader(r) as a Scanner, which is a known terminology from the stdlib.)

YAGNI

I also want to focus this package as doing one thing — split your bytes into words/graphemes/sentences. Things to delete:

❌ We offer Filter and Transform. But we don’t add any value to those things, we just “integrate” them. The caller can filter or transform as they wish. Shouldn’t be in this package.

❌ The All methods which collect the iterators into a slice. We don’t offer much value there. Our pre-allocation might be a little more efficient. I intend to delete these, and then after everything above is done, maybe offer a Collect() method a la Rust iterators.

✅ Joiners is something we can do more efficiently than the caller. Keep.

Bits and bobs

The shared iterators/ package should be internal/.
