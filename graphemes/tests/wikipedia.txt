The emoji was predated by the [[emoticon]],<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/happy-30th-birthday-emoticon-8120158.html| title=Happy 30th Birthday Emoticon!| date=September 8, 2012| newspaper=Independent| access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> a basic text-based version of the now established [[Unicode]] emoji language and likely took inspiration from [[pictogram]]s. Numerous attempts in the 1990s were made in [[Europe]], [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] to enhance the basic [[emoticon]] to make it more desirable for use.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rd.com/culture/history-of-emoji/| title=Why Do We Use Emojis Anyway?

This dates back to the 1960s, when [[Russia]]n novelist and professor [[Vladimir Nabokov]] stated in an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'' ''"I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile ‚Äî some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket."''<ref name=Nabokov1973>{{Citation| last = Nabokov| first = Vladimir| year = 1973| title = Strong Opinions| pages = 133‚Äì134| doi = 10.2277/052153643X| isbn = 0-679-72609-8| location = New York| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780679726098}}</ref> However, it wasn't until the 1980s when computer scientist [[Scott Fahlman]] invented the [[emoticon]], by suggesting that :-) and :-( could replace language.<ref>{{Citation | title = -) turns 25| publisher = [[Associated Press]]| date = 2007-09-20| url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/09/18/emoticon.anniversary.ap/index.html| accessdate = 2007-09-20 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071012051803/http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/09/18/emoticon.anniversary.ap/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-12}}</ref>

In the early 1990s, there were a number of digital [[smiley]]s and [[emoticon]]s that were used in fonts, [[pictogram]]s, graphical representations, and even welcome messages. The font [[Wingdings]], designed and used on [[Microsoft]] platforms, used [[smiley]] and sad faces in its language and first appeared on [[Windows]] and other [[Microsoft]] platforms from 1990 onwards. In late 1995, it was announced in the French newspaper, [[Le Monde]], that telecoms company [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]] would be launching a mobile phone to be released in 1996. The newspaper article displays the BC 600, with the welcome screen displaying a digital [[smiley]] face.<ref>{{cite news |title=Souriez! Le GSM pr√©sente un nouveau visage |publisher=[[Le Monde]] |date=November 7, 1995 |language=French|page=13}}</ref> Versions of the [[Nokia]] phone also contained sets of graphics, which in 2001 they were still referring to as [[smiley]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Numerous claims have been made to who invented the first emoji. Those making the claims drew inspiration from many sources, including [[pictogram]]s and symbols, [[smiley]]s and digital interpretations of language. Some of the precursors to the emoji can include theories by both [[Vladimir Nabokov]] and [[Scott Fahlman]]. One of the more notable claims was by [[Shigetaka Kurita]] in 1999.<ref name=Steinmetz2015>{{cite web|last=Steinmetz|first=Katy|url=http://time.com/4114886/oxford-word-of-the-year-2015-emoji/|title=Oxford's 2015 Word of the Year Is This Emoji|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=November 16, 2015|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/11/emojis-rapid-evolution.html|title=Smile, You're Speaking Emoji|author=Sternbergh, Adam|date=November 16, 2014}}</ref> Kurita created a set of emojis while working on [[NTT DoCoMo]]'s [[i-mode]] [[Mobile web]] platform.<ref name="Meet Shigetaka Kurita, the Father of Emoji">{{cite web|last1=Negishi|first1=Mayumi|title=Meet Shigetaka Kurita, the Father of Emoji|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/03/26/meet-shigetaka-kurita-the-father-of-emoji|website=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=March 26, 2014|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}</ref> According to interviews, he took inspiration from weather pictograms, used to depict the weather conditions at any given time.

[[Emojipedia]] released findings in early 2019 stating they believed a set of 90 emojis for the J-Phone, predated Kurita's design. Known as the [[SoftBank]] emoji set, they predicted it dated back to 1997. The set was first released on [[Japan]]'s J-Phone and is the first phone known to contain a set of emojis as part of its typeface. Many of the images would later be included in the [[Unicode Standard]], such as [[Pile of Poo emoji|Pile of Poo]]. The J-Phone didn't sell well due to its high retail price and therefore mass-market adoption didn't take place at the time.<ref>{{Cite web | last=Alt | first=Matt | title=Why Japan Got Over Emojis | url=https://slate.com/technology/2015/12/emojis-are-no-longer-cool-in-japan.html | date=December 7, 2015 | accessdate=January 22, 2019 }}</ref> The first set of emojis by [[SoftBank]] contained no color, unlike Kurita's which did use color. Both sets were made up of generic images that depicted, numbers, sports, the time, moon phases and the weather. Both Kurita and [[SoftBank]]'s designs were 12 x 12 pixels emoji pictograms.<ref>{{cite web |title=Correcting the Record on the First Emoji Set |url=https://blog.emojipedia.org/correcting-the-record-on-the-first-emoji-set/ |publisher=[[Emojipedia]] |date=March 8, 2019}}</ref>

[[Japan]] was the first country to widely adopt the early emoji sets for use on [[mobile phone]]s. [[Mobile phone industry in Japan#Providers|Japanese mobile operators]] NTT DoCoMo, [[au (mobile phone company)|au]], and [[SoftBank Mobile]] (formerly [[Vodafone]]) all implemented emoji sets in the late 1990s to their phones. These companies each defined their own variants of emoji using proprietary standards. The first set of 176 12√ó12 pixel emoji was created as part of i-mode's messaging features to help facilitate electronic communication, and to serve as a distinguishing feature from other services.<ref name=":0"/> Kurita created the first 180 emoji based on the expressions that he observed people making and other things in the city.<ref name="Why and how I created emoji"/> 

When transmitted on NTT DoCoMo, emoji symbols are specified as a two-[[byte]] sequence, in the private-use range E63E through E757 in the [[Unicode]] character space, or F89F through F9FC for [[Shift JIS]]. The basic specification has 1706 symbols, with 76 more added in phones that support [[C-HTML]] 4.0. Emoji pictograms by Japanese mobile phone brand [[Au (mobile phone company)|Au]] are specified using the [[HTML element#Images and objects|IMG tag]].{{dubious|reason=KDDI (au) have a Shift_JIS emoji format listed in EmojiSources.txt from the Unicode Character Database, and also available in ICU.

===Development of emoji sets (2000‚Äì2009)===
The basic 12x12 pixel emoji in [[Japan]] grew in popularity across various platforms over the next decade. This was aided by the introduction of [[i-mode]], which for many was the origins of the [[smartphone]]. [[i-mode]] also saw the introduction of emojis in conversation form on messenger [[Application software|apps]]. By 2004, [[i-mode]] had 40 million subscribers, meaning numerous people were exposed to the emoji for the first time between 2000 and 2004. The popularity of i-mode led to other manufacturers competing with similar offerings and therefore developed their own emoji sets. While emoji adoption was high in [[Japan]] during this time, the companies failed to collaborate and come up with a uniform set of emojis to be used across all platforms in the country.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blagdon |first1=Jeff |title=How emoji conquered the world |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/4/3966140/how-emoji-conquered-the-world |publisher=[[The Verge]] |date=March 4, 2013}}</ref>

The [[Universal Coded Character Set]] ([[Unicode]]), overseen by the [[Unicode Consortium]] and [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2]], had been established as the international standard for text representation ([[ISO/IEC 10646]]) since 1993, although variants of [[Shift JIS]] remained relatively common in Japan. Unicode included several characters which would subsequently be classified as emoji, including some from [[North America]]n or [[Western Europe]]an sources such as [[ITC Zapf Dingbats]] or [[Code page 437|DOS code page 437]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Unicode 1.1 Emoji List |url=https://emojipedia.org/unicode-1.1/ |publisher=[[Emojipedia]]}}</ref> but had not incorporated the Japanese cellular emoji characters. Unicode's coverage of written characters was extended several times by new editions during the 2000s, with little interest in incorporating the Japanese cellular emoji sets, although symbol characters which would subsequently be classified as emoji continued to be added. For example, Unicode 4.0 release contained 16 new emojis, which included direction arrows, a yellow warning, and an eject button.<ref>{{cite web |title=Unicode 4.0 List |url=https://emojipedia.org/unicode-4.0/ |publisher=[[Emojipedia]]}}</ref>

Additionally, other [[dingbat]] fonts such as [[Wingdings]] or [[Webdings]] included additional pictographic symbols in custom [[pi font]] encodings. For example, a [[national park]] pictogram (üèû) was available in Webdings at [[hexadecimal|0x]]50, corresponding to the capital letter [[P (letter)|P]] in [[ASCII]]. Unlike Zapf Dingbats, many of these would not be available as Unicode emoji until 2014.<ref name="hexuswebdings" />

[[The Smiley Company]] developed The Smiley Dictionary, which was launched in 2001. The desktop platform was aimed at allowing people to insert smileys as text when sending emails and writing on a [[desktop computer]].<ref name=eveningstandard>{{cite web |last1=Speare-Cole |first1=Rebecca |title=Man behind iconic smiley face symbol says limited number of emojis restricts freedom of speech |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/man-behind-iconic-smiley-face-symbol-says-limited-number-of-emojis-restricts-freedom-of-speech-a4282786.html |publisher=[[Evening Standard]]}}</ref> The smiley toolbar offered a variety of symbols and smileys and was used on platforms such as [[MSN Messenger]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Golby |first1=Joel |title=The Man Who Owns the Smiley Face |url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/j5pyyb/the-man-who-owns-the-smiley-face |publisher=[[Vice (magazine)]] |date=August 9, 2017}}</ref> [[Nokia]] as one of the largest telecoms companies globally at the time, were still referring to today's emoji sets as [[smiley]]s in 2001.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The digital smiley movement¬†was headed up by Nicolas Loufrani, the CEO of¬†The Smiley Company.<ref name=eveningstandard /> He created a smiley toolbar, which was  available at smileydictionary.com during the early 2000s to be sent as emojis are today.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hutchins |first1=Robert |title=SmileyWorld's CEO Nicolas Loufrani on plagiarism, the school market and a push for more toys |url=https://www.licensing.biz/smileyworlds-ceo-nicolas-loufrani-on-plagiarism-the-school-market-and-a-push-for-more-toys/ |publisher=[[Licensing.biz]] |date=March 7, 2016}}</ref>

Mobile providers in both the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] began discussions on how to introduce their own emoji sets from 2004 onwards. It wasn't until [[Google]] employees requested that [[Unicode]] look into the possibility of a uniform emoji set did many companies begin to take the emoji seriously. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] quickly followed and began to collaborate with not only [[Google]], but also providers in [[Europe]] and [[Japan]]. In August 2007, [[Mark Davis (Unicode)|Mark Davis]] and his colleagues Kat Momoi and Markus Scherer wrote the first draft for consideration by the Unicode Technical Committee to introduce emojis into the [[Unicode|Unicode standard]]. Peter Edberg and Yasuo Kida joined the collaborative efforts from [[Apple Inc.]] shortly after and the official UTC proposal as co-authors came in January 2009. 

Separately, a proposal had been submitted in 2008 to add the [[ARIB STD B24 character set|ARIB extended characters]] used in broadcasting in Japan to Unicode. This included several pictographic symbols.<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1 |url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2008/08077r2-japanese-tv.pdf |title=Japanese TV Symbols |id=UTC L2/08-077R2 / ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 N3397 |last=Suignard |first=Michel |date=2008-03-11}}</ref> These were added in Unicode 5.2 in 2009, a year before the cellular emoji sets were fully added; they include several characters which either also appeared amongst the cellular emoji<ref name="utcL210132">{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2010/10132-emojidata.pdf |id=UTC L2/10-132 |title=Emoji Symbols: Background Data‚ÄîBackground data for Proposal for Encoding Emoji Symbols |first1=Markus |last1=Scherer |first2=Mark |last2=Davis |first3=Kat |last3=Momoi |first4=Darick |last4=Tong |first5=Yasuo |last5=Kida |first6=Peter |last6=Edberg}}</ref> or were subsequently classified as emoji.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://emojipedia.org/unicode-5.2/ |title=Unicode 5.2 Emoji List |work=Emojipedia |author=Emojipedia |author-link=Emojipedia}}</ref>

Throughout 2009, members of the [[Unicode Consortium]] and national standardization bodies of various countries gave feedback and proposed changes to the international standardization of the emoji. The feedback from various bodies in the United States, Europe, and Japan agreed on a set of 722 emojis as the standard set, which would be released in 2010 as Unicode 6.0. This is seen by many as the first true set of uniform emojis due to the sheer number of emojis that were introduced, as only 15% (114) of the 722 emojis can be traced back to emoji sets prior to Unicode 6.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/faq/emoji_dingbats.html|title=FAQ ‚Äì Emoji & Dingbats|work=unicode.org}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

===Modern-day emojis (2010‚Äìpresent)===
The introduction of the new emojis by [[Unicode]] in 2009, saw the introduction of some of the most notable emojis used today. Despite the long association with [[Japan]], emojis like [[Face with Tears of Joy emoji|Tears of Joy]] had no origin in the country and can only be traced back to [[Unicode|Unicode 6.0]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Meisenzahl |first1=Mary |title=We now know the 10 most popular emoji for the first time ever |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/most-popular-emoji-unicode-consortium-2019-10?r=US&IR=T#7-two-hearts-4 |publisher=[[BusinessInsider]] |date=October 11, 2019}}</ref> The introduction of the new emojis had numerous teething issues, with feedback from many on the cultural differences between different countries and also the misuse. Famously, both the peach and the eggplant were used for other meanings and others were often used for criminal purposes. This led to the gun emoji getting removed and replaced with a water gun.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

The popularity of emoji has caused pressure from vendors and international markets to add additional designs into the Unicode standard to meet the demands of different cultures. Unicode 7.0 added approximately 250 emoji, many from the [[Webdings]] and [[Wingdings]] fonts.<ref name="hexuswebdings">{{cite web| url=http://hexus.net/tech/news/software/71157-host-new-characters-emoji-introduced-unicode-70/| title=Host of New Characters and Emoji Introduced in Unicode 7.0| date=June 17, 2014| publisher=Hexus| access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> Some characters now defined as emoji are inherited from a variety of pre-Unicode messenger systems not only used in Japan, including [[Yahoo Messenger|Yahoo]] and [[MSN Messenger]].<ref name="Emoji Additions: Animals, Compatibility, and More Popular Requests; Emoji tranche 5">{{cite web|title=Emoji Additions: Animals, Compatibility, and More Popular Requests; Emoji tranche 5|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2015/15054r4-emoji-tranche5.pdf|publisher=Unicode|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}</ref> Unicode 8.0 added another 41 emoji, including articles of sports equipment such as the cricket bat, food items such as the [[taco]], signs of the [[Zodiac]], new facial expressions, and symbols for places of worship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unicode 8.0.0|url=http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/|publisher=Unicode Consortium|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref> Corporate demand for emoji standardization has placed pressures on the Unicode Consortium, with some members complaining that it had overtaken the group's traditional focus on standardizing characters used for minority languages and transcribing historical records.<ref name="Inside 'Emojigeddon'">{{cite web|last1=Warzel|first1=Charlie|title=Inside 'Emojigeddon': The Fight Over The Future of the Unicode Consortium|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/inside-emojigeddon-the-fight-over-the-future-of-the-unicode|website=Buzzfeed|accessdate=September 15, 2017}}</ref>

Some Apple emoji are very similar to the SoftBank standard, since SoftBank was the first Japanese network on which the iPhone launched. For example, {{unichar|1F483|DANCER|nlink=üíÉ}} is female on Apple and SoftBank standards but male or gender-neutral on others.<ref name="How Emoji Get Lost In Translation">{{cite news|last1=Bosker|first1=Bianca|title=How Emoji Get Lost in Translation|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/27/emoji-meaning_n_5530638.html|work=Huffington Post|date=June 27, 2014|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}</ref>

Journalists have noted that the ambiguity of emoji has allowed them to take on culture-specific meanings not present in the original [[glyph]]s. For example, {{unichar|1F485|NAIL POLISH|nlink=üíÖ}} has been described as being used in English-language communities to signify "non-caring fatuousness" and "anything from shutting [[wikt:hater|haters]] down to a sense of accomplishment".<ref name="How to (pretend to) be young and down with the internet">{{cite news|last1=Hern|first1=Alex|title=How to (pretend to) be young and down with the internet|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/12/how-to-be-young-internet-lol-facebook|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 12, 2015|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}</ref><ref name="The 31 Most Nail Care Emoji Moments Of 2014">{{cite web|last1=Jewell|first1=Hannah|title=The 31 Most Nail Care Emoji Moments of 2014|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahjewell/the-most-nail-care-emoji-moments-of-2014|website=Buzzfeed|date=December 13, 2014|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}</ref><ref name="The Five Non-Negotiable Best Emojis in the Land">{{cite web|first1=Alexander|last1=Abad-Santos|first2=Allie |last2=Jones|title=The Five Non-Negotiable Best Emojis in the Land|url=http://www.thewire.com/culture/2014/03/the-only-five-emojis-you-need/359646/|website=The Atlantic Wire|date= March 26, 2014|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}</ref> Unicode manuals sometimes provide notes on auxiliary meanings of an object to guide designers on how emoji may be used, for example noting that some users may expect {{unichar|1F4BA|SEAT}} to stand for "a reserved or ticketed seat, as for an airplane, train, or theater".<ref name="Unicode Consortium">{{cite web|title=Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/beta/nameslist/n_1F300.html|website=Unicode Consortium|accessdate=September 15, 2017}}</ref>

==<span id="Emoji communication problems">Emoji communication problems</span>==
Research has shown that emoji are often misunderstood. In some cases, this misunderstanding is related to how the actual emoji design is interpreted by the viewer;<ref name="DailyDotMisunderstandEmojis">{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailydot.com/debug/emoji-miscommunicate/|title=Emoji can lead to huge misunderstandings, research finds|work=Daily Dot|first=Selena|last=Larson|date=April 11, 2016|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref> in other cases, the emoji that was sent is not shown in the same way on the receiving side.<ref name="GrouplensEmojiMiscommunication">{{Cite web|url=https://grouplens.org/blog/investigating-the-potential-for-miscommunication-using-emoji/|title=Investigating the Potential for Miscommunication Using Emoji|publisher=Grouplens|first=Hannah|last=Miller|date=April 5, 2016|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref>

The first issue relates to the cultural or contextual interpretation of the emoji. When the author picks an emoji, they think about it in a certain way, but the same character may not trigger the same thoughts in the mind of the receiver.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/78kzn9/what-the-emoji-youre-sending-actually-look-like-to-your-friends| title=What the Emoji You're Sending Actually Look Like to Your Friends| date=November 12, 2015| publisher=Motherboard| access-date=November 30, 2017}}</ref> (See also [[Models of communication]].)

For example, people in China have developed a system for using emoji subversively, so that a smiley face could be sent to convey a despising, mocking, and even obnoxious attitude, as the orbicularis oculi (the muscle near that upper eye corner) on the face of the emoji does not move, and the orbicularis oris (the one near the mouth) tightens, which is believed to be a sign of suppressing a smile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/944693/chinese-people-mean-something-very-different-when-they-send-you-a-smiley-emoji/ |title=Chinese people mean something very different when they send you a smiley emoji |website=Quartz|date=March 29, 2017}}</ref>

The second problem relates to technology and branding. When an author of a message picks an emoji from a list, it is normally encoded in a non-graphical manner during the transmission, and if the author and the reader do not use the same software or operating system for their devices, the reader's device may visualize the same emoji in a different way. Small changes to a character's look may completely alter its perceived meaning with the receiver.

===Controversial emoji===
Some emoji have been involved in controversy due to their perceived meanings. Multiple arrests and imprisonments have followed usage of pistol ({{unichar|1F52B}}), knife ({{unichar|1F5E1}}), and bomb ({{unichar|1F4A3}}) emoji in ways that were deemed by authorities to constitute credible threats.<ref name=AppleGun>{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/01/technology/apple-pistol-emoji/index.html |title=Apple replaces the pistol emoji with a water gun |last=Kelly |first=Heather |website=[[CNN]] Tech |date=August 2, 2017 |access-date=October 19, 2017}}</ref>

In the lead-up to the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], the Unicode Consortium considered proposals to add several Olympic-related emoji, including medals and events such as [[handball]] and [[water polo]].<ref name=newsweek>{{cite web |url=https://www.newsweek.com/new-emoji-candidates-be-voted-spring-2016-385196 |title=New Emoji Candidates to Be Voted On in Spring 2016 |last=Ziv |first=Stan |website=[[Newsweek]] |date=20 October 2015 |access-date=1 October 2018}}</ref> By October 2015, these candidate emoji included "[[ISSF shooting events|rifle]]" ({{unichar|1F946}}) and "[[modern pentathlon]]" ({{unichar|1F93B}}).<ref name=ep20151031>{{Cite news |url=https://emojipedia.org/unicode-9.0/ |title=Unicode 9.0 Emoji List |date=31 October 2015 |work=Emojipedia |access-date=1 October 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031233229/https://emojipedia.org/unicode-9.0/ |archive-date=2015-10-31 |url-status=unfit}}</ref><ref name="OlympicRifle" /> However, in 2016, Apple and Microsoft opposed these two emoji, and the characters were added without emoji presentations, meaning that software is expected to render them in black-and-white rather than color, and emoji-specific software such as onscreen keyboards will generally not include them. In addition, while the original incarnations of the modern pentathlon emoji depicted its five events, including a man pointing a gun, the final glyph contains a person riding a horse, along with a laser pistol target in the corner.<ref name=AppleGun /><ref name="OlympicRifle">{{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/thanks-to-apples-influence-youre-not-getting-a-rifle-emoji |title=Thanks To Apple's Influence, You're Not Getting A Rifle Emoji |last=Warzel |first=Charlie |website=[[BuzzFeed]] |date=June 17, 2016 |access-date=October 19, 2017}}</ref><ref name=AppleStops>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/trending/rifle-emoji-dropped-unicode-9-0-update-apple-microsoft-1.3645884 |title=Apple stops Unicode from releasing a rifle emoji, gun advocates get mad |website=[[CBC News]] |date=June 22, 2016 |access-date=October 19, 2017}}</ref>

==Emoji versus text presentation==
Unicode defines [[Variant form (Unicode)|variation sequences]] for many of its emoji to indicate their desired presentation.
{{quote |text=Emoji characters can have two main kinds of presentation:
* an ''emoji presentation'', with colorful and perhaps whimsical shapes, even animated
* a ''text presentation'', such as black & white |source=Unicode Technical Report #51: Unicode Emoji<ref name="UTR51"/>}}

Specifying the desired presentation is done by following the base emoji with either U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 (VS15) for text or U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 (VS16) for emoji-style.<ref name="UniStdVarTxt">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/StandardizedVariants.txt|title=UCD: Standardized Variation Sequences|publisher=Unicode Consortium|accessdate=August 17, 2016}}</ref>

==Skin color==
{{Main|Emoji modifiers}}

Five symbol modifier characters were added with Unicode 8.0 to provide a range of skin tones for human emoji. These modifiers are called EMOJI MODIFIER FITZPATRICK TYPE-1-2, {{not a typo|-|3}}, {{not a typo|-|4}}, {{not a typo|-|5}}, and {{not a typo|-|6}} (U+1F3FB‚ÄìU+1F3FF): üèª üèº üèΩ üèæ üèø. They are based on the [[Fitzpatrick scale]] for classifying human skin color. Human emoji that are not followed by one of these five modifiers should be displayed in a generic, non-realistic skin tone, such as bright yellow (<span style="color: #ffcc22;font-size:large;">‚ñ†</span>), blue (<span style="color: #3399CC;font-size:large;">‚ñ†</span>), or gray (<span style="color: #CCCCCC;font-size:large;">‚ñ†</span>).<ref name="UTR51"/> Non-human emoji (like {{unichar|26FD|FUEL PUMP}}) are unaffected by the Fitzpatrick modifiers.
As of Unicode 13.0, Fitzpatrick modifiers can be used with 116 human emoji spread across six blocks: [[Dingbat#Skin tones|Dingbats]], [[Emoticons (Unicode block)#Skin tones|Emoticons]], [[Miscellaneous Symbols#Skin tones|Miscellaneous Symbols]], [[Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs#Skin tones|Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs]], [[Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs#Skin tones|Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs]], and [[Transport and Map Symbols#Skin tones|Transport and Map Symbols]].<ref name="EmojiData"/>

The following table shows both the Unicode characters and the open-source "Twemoji" images, designed by [[Twitter]]:

==Joining==
Implementations may use [[Zero-width joiner|U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER]] (ZWJ) between emoji to make them behave like a single, unique emoji character.<ref name="UTR51"/>
(Systems that don't support this should ignore the ZWJ character.)

For example, the sequence U+1F468 MAN, U+200D ZWJ, U+1F469 WOMAN, U+200D ZWJ, U+1F467 GIRL (üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß) could be displayed as a single emoji depicting a family with a man, a woman, and a girl if the implementation supports it. Systems that don't support it would ignore the ZWJs, showing the base emoji in the sequence: U+1F468 MAN, U+1F469 WOMAN, U+1F467 GIRL (üë®üë©üëß).

Unicode previously maintained a catalog of emoji ZWJ sequences that are supported on at least one commonly available platform. The consortium has since switched to only document sequences that are ''recommended for general interchange'' (RGI).<ref name="ZWJSequences">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-zwj-sequences.html|title=Emoji ZWJ Sequences Catalog|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=June 14, 2016}}</ref>

==Unicode blocks==
{{split section|Unicode emojis|discuss=Talk:Emoji#Split proposed for Unicode blocks section to Unicode emojis article|date=October 2019}}
{{Main|Dingbat#Dingbats Unicode block|l1=Dingbats (Unicode block)|Emoticons (Unicode block)|Miscellaneous Symbols|l3=Miscellaneous Symbols (Unicode block)|Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs|l4=Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs (Unicode block)|Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs|l5=Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs (Unicode block)|Symbols and Pictographs Extended-A|l6=Symbols and Pictographs Extended-A (Unicode block)|Transport and Map Symbols|l7=Transport and Map Symbols (Unicode block)}}
Unicode 13.0 represents emoji using 1,367 characters spread across 24 blocks, of which 26 are [[Regional Indicator Symbol]]s that combine in pairs to form flag emoji, and 12 (#, * and 0‚Äì9) are base characters for [[keycap]] emoji sequences:<ref name="EmojiData">{{Cite web|url=https://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/emoji/emoji-data.txt|title=UCD: Emoji Data for UTR #51|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=January 28, 2020}}</ref><ref name="UTR51">{{Cite web|url=https://unicode.org/reports/tr51/|title=UTR #51: Unicode Emoji|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=February 11, 2020}}</ref>

637 of the 768 code points in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs]] block are considered emoji. 240 of the 254 code points in the [[Supplemental Symbols and Pictographs]] block are considered emoji.  All of the 57 code points in the [[Symbols and Pictographs Extended-A]] block are considered emoji.  All of the 80 code points in the [[Emoticons]] block are considered emoji. 101 of the 114 code points in the [[Transport and Map Symbols]] block are considered emoji. 83 of the 256 code points in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] block are considered emoji. 33 of the 192 code points in the [[Dingbat#Unicode|Dingbats]] block are considered emoji.

{{Emoji (Unicode block)}}

Additional emoji can be found in the following Unicode blocks: [[Arrows (Unicode block)|Arrows]] (8 code points considered emoji), [[Basic Latin (Unicode block)|Basic Latin]] (12), [[CJK Symbols and Punctuation]] (2), [[Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement]] (41), [[Enclosed Alphanumerics]] (1), [[Enclosed CJK Letters and Months]] (2), [[Enclosed Ideographic Supplement]] (15), [[General Punctuation]] (2), [[Geometric Shapes]] (8), [[Geometric Shapes Extended]] (12), [[Latin-1 Supplement (Unicode block)|Latin-1 Supplement]] (2), [[Letterlike Symbols]] (2), [[Mahjong Tiles (Unicode block)|Mahjong Tiles]] (1), [[Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows (Unicode block)|Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows]] (7), [[Miscellaneous Technical]] (18), [[Playing cards in Unicode|Playing Cards]] (1), and [[Supplemental Arrows-B (Unicode block)|Supplemental Arrows-B]] (2).

===Additions===
Some vendors, most notably Microsoft, Samsung and HTC, add emoji presentation to some other existing Unicode characters or coin their own ZWJ sequences.

Microsoft displays all [[Mahjong Tiles (Unicode block)|Mahjong tiles]] (U+1F000‚Ä•2B, not just {{unichar|1F004|MAHJONG TILE RED DRAGON}}) and alternative card suits ({{unichar|2661}}, {{unichar|2662}}, {{unichar|2664}}, {{unichar|2666}}) as emoji. They also support additional pencils ({{unichar|270E}}, {{unichar|2710}}) and a heart-shaped bullet ({{unichar|2765}}).

While only {{unichar|261D}} is officially an emoji, Microsoft and Samsung add the other three directions as well ({{unichar|261C}}, {{unichar|261E}}, {{unichar|261F}}).
Both vendors pair the standard checked ballot box emoji {{unichar|2611}} with its crossed variant {{unichar|2612}}, but only Samsung also has the empty ballot box {{unichar|2610}}.

Samsung almost completely covers the rest of the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] block (U+2600‚Ä•FF) as emoji, which includes Chess pieces, game die faces, some traffic sign as well as genealogical and astronomical symbols for instance.

HTC supports most additional pictographs from the [[Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs]] (U+1F300‚Ä•5FF) and [[Transport and Map Symbols]] (U+1F680‚Ä•FF) blocks. Some of them are also shown as emoji on Samsung devices.

The open source projects Emojidex and Emojitwo are trying to cover all of these extensions established by major vendors.

==Implementation==
The exact appearance of emoji is not prescribed but varies between fonts, in the same way that normal typefaces can display letters differently. For example, the [[Apple Color Emoji]] typeface is proprietary to Apple, and can only be used on Apple devices (without additional [[Hacker culture#Programming|hacking]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=[MOD] Apple Color Emoji system-wide for KitKat+ (updated with unicorns)|url=http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2563757|publisher=XDA Developers|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref> Different computing companies have developed their own fonts to display emoji, some of which have been [[Open source software|open-sourced]] to permit their reuse.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Davidson|first1=Mike|title=Open sourcing Twitter emoji for everyone|url=https://blog.twitter.com/2014/open-sourcing-twitter-emoji-for-everyone|website=Twitter developer blog|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Emoji One: Open Source Emoji|url=http://www.emojione.com|publisher=Emoji One|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref> Both colour and monochrome emoji typefaces exist, as well as at least one animated design.<ref>{{cite web|last1=El Khoury|first1=Rita|title=Woohoo!

===Android===
[[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices support emoji differently depending on the operating system version. Google added native emoji support to Android in July 2013 with Android 4.3,<ref name="CNet_4.3">{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/products/google-android-4-3-jelly-bean/|title=Google Android 4.3 is here, and it tastes like Jelly Bean|publisher=}}</ref> and to the Google Keyboard in November 2013 for devices running Android 4.4 and later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/124960-google-adds-sms-to-hangouts-android-app-emoji-to-kitkat-keyboard|title=Google adds SMS to Hangouts Android app, Emoji to KitKat keyboard|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref> Android 7.0 Nougat added Unicode 9 emoji, skin tone modifiers, and a redesign of many existing emoji.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blog.emojipedia.org/android-7-0-emoji-changelog/|title=Android 7.0 Nougat Emoji Changelog|date=August 22, 2016|access-date=August 23, 2016}}</ref>

Emoji are also supported by the [[Google Hangouts]] application (independent of the keyboard in use), in both Hangouts and [[Text messaging|SMS]] modes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.talk|title=Hangouts ‚Äì Google Play|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref> Several third-party messaging and keyboard applications (such as IQQI Keyboard) for Android devices<ref>{{cite web|url=https://market.android.com/search?q=emoji&c=apps|title=emoji ‚Äì Google Play|publisher=Market.android.com|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref> provide plugins that allow the use of emoji.

Until 2016, mobile phone vendors HTC and LG deployed variants of NotoColorEmoji.ttf with custom glyphs; Samsung still does. Some Japanese mobile carriers used to equip branded Android devices with emoji glyphs that were closer to the original ones, but apparently have stopped updating these circa 2015.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

===Apple===
Apple first introduced emoji to their desktop operating system with the release of [[macOS|OS X]] [[Mac OS X Lion|10.7 Lion]], in 2011. Users can view emoji characters sent through email and messaging applications, which are commonly shared by mobile users, as well as any other application. Users can create emoji symbols using the "Characters" special input panel from almost any native application by selecting the "Edit" menu and pulling down to "Special Characters", or by the key combination {{key press|Command|Option|T}}. The desktop OS uses the [[Apple Color Emoji]] font that was introduced earlier in [[iOS]]. This provides users with full color pictographs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://osxdaily.com/2011/08/20/emoji-mac-os-x-lion|title=Access and Use Emoji in Mac OS X|publisher=Osxdaily.com|date=August 20, 2011|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref>

The emoji keyboard was first available in Japan with the release of [[iPhone OS 2|iPhone OS version 2.2]] in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Apple releases iPhone Software v2.2|url=https://appleinsider.com/article/?id=10447|website=AppleInsider|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}</ref> The emoji keyboard was not officially made available outside of Japan until [[iOS 5|iOS version 5.0]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Standard Emoji keyboard arrives to iOS 5, here's how to enable it|url=https://9to5mac.com/2011/06/08/standard-emoji-keyboard-arrives-to-ios-5-heres-how-to-enable-it/|website=9to5Mac|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}</ref> From iPhone OS 2.2 through to iOS 4.3.5 (2011), those outside Japan could access the keyboard but had to use a third party app to enable it.

On September 12, 2017, Apple announced that the [[Messages (software)|Messages]] app on the [[iPhone]]s with [[Face ID]] would get "animoji", which are versions of standard emoji that are custom-animated with the use of [[facial motion capture]] to reflect the sender's expressions. These animoji can also utilize [[lip sync]] to appear to speak audio messages recorded by the sender. Apple had created 3D models of all standard emoji prior to its late-2016 OS updates from which the static default 2D graphics had been rendered. A select set of these models are being reused for creating still images and short animations dynamically.

With the release of [[iOS 13]], Apple introduced "memoji" that allows the use of an avatar that a user can use to personalize messages; this feature does not require Face ID.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/450743/how-to-create-and-use-memoji-and-animoji-on-an-iphone/|title=How to Create and Use Memoji and Animoji on an iPhone|publisher=How to Geek|date=2020-01-18|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>

===Microsoft Windows===
An update for the Segoe UI Symbol font in [[Windows 7]] and in Windows Server 2008 R2 brought a subset of the monochrome Unicode set to those operating systems.<ref name="An update for the Segoe UI symbol font in Windows 7 and in Windows Server 2008 R2 is available">{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2729094|title=An update for the Segoe UI symbol font in Windows 7 and in Windows Server 2008 R2 is available|publisher=Microsoft Support}}</ref> The font update rebranded the font as ''Segoe UI Symbol''. The difference between the two fonts is that Segoe UI lacks any and all emoji characters, while Segoe UI Symbol and Segoe UI Emoji include them. [[Windows 8]] and higher supports the full Unicode emoji characters through Microsoft's [[Segoe UI]] family of fonts. Emoji characters are accessed through the onscreen keyboard's "smiley" key. As of [[Windows 8.1]] Preview, Segoe UI Emoji font supplies full-color pictographs. Differently from macOS and iOS, color glyphs are only supplied when the application supports Microsoft's [[DirectWrite]] API, and Segoe UI Emoji is explicitly declared, otherwise monochrome glyphs appear.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/globalization/mt791278| title=Script and Font Support in Windows| publisher=Microsoft| access-date=August 23, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923123305/https://msdn.microsoft.com/globalization/mt791278| archive-date=September 23, 2017| url-status=dead}}</ref> Segoe UI Emoji and its full-color emoji set is not fully supported by all programs written for Windows; for example, among Web browsers, [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Google Chrome]] can use the font, but [[Firefox]] initially did not (that browser now supports full color emoji and includes the EmojiOne set in installation).

===Internationalized domain names===
{{Main|Emoji domain|Internationalized domain name}}

A limited number of [[top-level domain]]s allow registration of domain names containing emoji characters. Emoji-containing subdomains are also possible under any top-level domain.

===Social media===
[[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] replace all Unicode emoji used on their websites with their own custom graphics.

Facebook has different sets for the main site and for its Messenger service, where only the former provides complete coverage. [[Facebook reactions]] are only partially compatible with standard emoji.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Twitter has released Twemoji, which is their emoji graphics together with a Javascript library to handle them, under the [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 license]] and the [[MIT License|MIT open-source license]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web |title=GitHub ‚Äì twitter/twemoji: Twitter Emoji for Everyone |url=https://github.com/twitter/twemoji |website=[[GitHub]] |date=July 20, 2017 |accessdate=September 24, 2017}}</ref> The Android and iOS Twitter apps use emoji native to the platform they are running on.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

===General===
Any operating system that supports adding additional fonts to the system can add an emoji-supporting font.

EmojiOne version 2.3, an open-source font available under free license, supports the full emoji set in color through Unicode Emoji 3.0, i.e. Unicode 9.0. EmojiOne version 3.1, with a stricter license that disallows the redistribution of vector images, supports Unicode Emoji 5.0, hence characters added in Unicode 10.0. EmojiTwo, an open-source fork of EmojiOne 2.3, aims to add all emoji from 2017 and later.

Note, however, that not all operating systems have support for color fonts, so in these cases emoji might have to be rendered as black-and-white line art or not at all. [[OpenType]] version 1.8 standardizes four different formats for color fonts: one built upon standard glyphs and backed by Microsoft; one built upon [[SVG]] and backed by Mozilla, Adobe, and others; one based upon [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] chunks and backed by Google; and one supporting a variety of embedded image formats, but preferably PNG, backed by Apple. This means that color fonts need to come in several formats to be usable on multiple operating systems.

The font ''Symbola'' contains all emoji through version 10.0 as normal monochrome glyphs. Through version 10, Symbola was a [[Open-source Unicode typefaces|public domain font]]; beginning with version 11 in 2018, Symbola has been copyrighted with a ban on commercial use and derivative works. Other typefaces including a significant number of emoji characters include [[Noto fonts|Noto Emoji]], Adobe Source Emoji, and [[Quivira (typeface)|Quivira]].
