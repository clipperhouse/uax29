An implementation of “phrase boundaries”, a variation on words boundaries from [Unicode text segmentation](https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Word_Boundaries) (UAX 29).

“Phrases” are not a Unicode standard, it is our definition that we think may be useful. We define it as “a series of words separated only by spaces”. Punctuation breaks phrases. Emojis are treated as words.

## Quick start

```
go get "github.com/clipperhouse/uax29/phrases"
```

```go
text := []byte("Hello, 世界. Nice — and totally adorable — dog; perhaps the “best one”! 🏆 🐶")

phrase := phrases.NewSegmenter(text)

// Next returns true until error or end of data
for phrase.Next() {
	// Do something with the phrase
	fmt.Printf("%q\n", phrase.Bytes())
}

// Gotta check the error!
if err := phrase.Err(); err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
// Output: "Hello"
// ","
// " "
// "世"
// "界"
// "."
// " Nice "
// "—"
// " and totally adorable "
// "—"
// " dog"
// ";"
// " perhaps the "
// "“"
// "best one"
// "”"
// "!"
// " 🏆 🐶"
```

_Note: this package will return all tokens, including punctuation — it's not strictly “phrases” in the common sense. If you wish to omit things certain tokens, use a filter (see below). For our purposes, “segment”, “phrase”, and “token” are used synonymously._

## APIs

#### If you have a `[]byte`

Use `Segmenter` for bounded memory and best performance:

```go
text := []byte("Hello, 世界. Nice dog! 👍🐶")

segments := phrases.NewSegmenter(text)            // A segmenter is an iterator over the phrases

for segments.Next() {                           // Next() returns true until end of data or error
	fmt.Printf("%q\n", segments.Bytes())        // Do something with the current phrase
}

if segments.Err() != nil {                      // Check the error
	log.Fatal(segments.Err())
}
```

Use `SegmentAll()` if you prefer brevity, and are not too concerned about allocations.

```go
segments := phrases.SegmentAll(text)             // Returns a slice of byte slices; each slice is a phrase

fmt.Println("phrases: %q", segments)
```

#### If you have an `io.Reader`

Use `Scanner`

```go
r := getYourReader()                            // from a file or network maybe
scanner := phrases.NewScanner(r)

for scanner.Scan() {                            // Scan() returns true until error or EOF
	fmt.Println(scanner.Text())                 // Do something with the current phrase
}

if scanner.Err() != nil {                       // Check the error
	log.Fatal(scanner.Err())
}
```

### Performance

On a Mac M2 laptop, we see around 240MB/s, which works out to around 30 million phrases (tokens, really) per second.

You should see approximately constant memory when using `Segmenter` or `Scanner`, independent of data size. When using `SegmentAll()`, expect memory to be `O(n)` on the number of phrases (one slice per phrase).

### Uses

The uax29 module has 4 tokenizers. In decreasing granularity: sentences → phrases → words → graphemes. You can tokenize the tokens of other tokenizers! If you're doing embeddings, you might decide to split sentences, and embed the phrases or words within the sentence, as a way of chunking “meaningful units”.

### Invalid inputs

Invalid UTF-8 input is considered undefined behavior. We test to ensure that bad inputs will not cause pathological outcomes, such as a panic or infinite loop. Callers should expect “garbage-in, garbage-out”.

Your pipeline should probably include a call to [`utf8.Valid()`](https://pkg.go.dev/unicode/utf8#Valid).

### Filters

You can add a filter to a `Scanner` or `Segmenter`.

For example, the Segmenter / Scanner returns _all_ tokens, split by phrase boundaries. This includes things like whitespace and punctuation, which may not be what one means by “phrases”. By using a filter, you can omit them.

```go
text := []byte("Hello, 世界. Nice dog! 👍🐶")

segments := phrases.NewSegmenter(text)
segments.Filter(filter.Wordlike)

for segments.Next() {
	// Note that whitespace and punctuation are omitted.
	fmt.Printf("%q\n", segments.Bytes())
}

if segments.Err() != nil {
	log.Fatal(segments.Err())
}
```

You can write your own filters (predicates), with arbitrary logic, by implementing a `func([]byte) bool`. You can also create a filter based on Unicode categories with the [`filter.Contains`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/clipperhouse/uax29/iterators/filter#Contains) and [`filter.Entirely`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/clipperhouse/uax29/iterators/filter#Entirely) methods.

### Transforms

Tokens can be modified by adding a transformer to a `Scanner` or `Segmenter`.

You might wish to lowercase all the phrases, for example:

```go
text := []byte("Hello, 世界. Nice dog! 👍🐶")

phrases := phrases.NewSegmenter(text)
phrases.Transform(transformer.Lower)

for phrases.Next() {
	// Note that tokens come out lowercase
	fmt.Printf("%q\n", phrases.Bytes())
}

if phrases.Err() != nil {
	log.Fatal(phrases.Err())
}
```
Here are a [few more examples](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/clipperhouse/uax29/iterators/transformer).

We use the [`x/text/transform`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/text/transform) package. We can accept anything that implements the `transform.Transformer` interface. Many things in `x/text` do that, such as [runes](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/text/runes), [normalization](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/text/unicode/norm), [casing](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/text/cases), and [encoding](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/text/encoding).

### Limitations

This package follows derives from the basic UAX #29 specification. For more idiomatic treatment of phrases across languages, there is more that can be done, scroll down to the [“Notes:” section of the standard](https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Word_Boundary_Rules):

> It is not possible to provide a uniform set of rules that resolves all issues across languages or that handles all ambiguous situations within a given language. The goal for the specification presented in this annex is to provide a workable default; tailored implementations can be more sophisticated.

I also found [this article](https://www.hathitrust.org/blogs/large-scale-search/multilingual-issues-part-1-word-segmentation) helpful.
