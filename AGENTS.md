This is a Go module containing several Go packages, which implement Unicode text segmentation UAX #29.

The splitfunc.go files in each package are where the important logic lives.

The required data is generated by the gen/ package. You will see that it downloads
the property categories from the Unicode website, and generates the tries for each
package.

You will notice that most of the "get category" operations are done with bitwise operators,
for performance.

Always work incrementally. Do the smallest piece of work, test its correctness, and
get my feedback.
