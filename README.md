An implementation of word boundaries from [Unicode text segmentation](https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Word_Boundaries) (UAX 29).

Originally created for use with [jargon](https://github.com/clipperhouse/jargon), text pipelines for Go.

Next step, hopefully, is to get the categories of UAX 29 [into their own RangeTables](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/_79vJ65KuXc/B_QgeU6rAgAJ).
